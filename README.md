# News-Website

I have developed a news website that allows users to view the latest news articles from various sources in a visually appealing manner.

**Tech Stack:**
The website was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the user interface and handle client-side interactions.

**API Integration:**
To obtain the latest news articles, the website integrates with a third-party news API. The API allows us to retrieve news data in a structured format.

**API Used:** gnews.io
